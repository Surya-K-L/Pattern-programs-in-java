# Java Pattern Programs 🎨

A collection of Java console programs demonstrating a variety of text and numeric patterns using loops, conditional logic, and core Java constructs.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each Java pattern program is contained in its own `.java` file in the root directory:

*(Update list to match your actual filenames.)*

## ✔️ Included Patterns

Typical examples you may find in the repo:

- **Hollow Rectangle** – e.g., a rectangle outline made with asterisks  
- **Solid Pyramid** – centered stars forming a pyramid  
- **Inverted Pyramid** – top-down star pattern  
- **Floyd’s Triangle** – numbers incrementing row-wise  
- **Number Triangle** – mirrored numeric arrangements  
- **Diamond Pattern** – symmetric pattern combining pyramids  
- **Zig-Zag Pattern** – diagonal star emulation  
- **Pascal’s Triangle** – binomial coefficients in triangle form  
*(List yours here.)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Surya-K-L/Pattern-programs-in-java.git
    cd Pattern-programs-in-java
    ```

2. **Compile** a program:
    ```bash
    javac PyramidPattern.java
    ```

3. **Run** the program:
    ```bash
    java PyramidPattern
    ```

Replace `PyramidPattern` with your desired program’s name.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Practice Java syntax including **loops** (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Understand **nested loops** and dynamic control of row/column structure
- Gain experience manipulating **strings**, **characters**, and **numbers**
- Grasp loop bounds, offsets, and console-based UI simulation
- Strengthen debugging skills for logic-intensive output

## 🛠️ Improvements & Contributions

You’re welcome to contribute enhancements such as:

- New patterns (e.g., butterfly, sandglass, alphabets)
- Parameterized programs where users define size
- Input-driven logic instead of hard-coded values
- README additions—screenshots or demos of each pattern
- Refactoring for readability and best practices
